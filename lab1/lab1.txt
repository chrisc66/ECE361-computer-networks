Part 1

1. What is the IP address of the host?
	192.168.0.107
2. What is the IP address of the router?
	192.168.0.1
3. What protocol is used to resolve the website domain name?
	DNS
4. What is the IP address of the HTTP server?
	128.100.72.45
5. Which transport layer protocol is used by DNS?
	UDP
6. Which well-known port is used when contacting the DNS server?
	53
7. Which ephemeral port does the host initiating the DNS query use?
	54883
8. What is the Ethernet address of the host?
	d8:30:62:62:70:5f
9. What is the Ethernet address of the router?
	00:13:46:a7:d3:02
10. How long does the 3-way handshake take to complete?
	0.025248s - 0.014746s = 0.010502s
11. Which website is the host machine trying to access?
	www.utoronto.ca
12. What version of HTTP is the browser running?
	HTTP 1.1
13. In the filter box enter the following query: ​ udp.dstport==53 ​ and click apply. What does the query mean and what are the results?
	inside DNS, DNS port = 53
14. Go to ​ Statistics - ​ > ​ Protocol Hierarchy ​ and answer:
A. What percentage of frames are Ethernet frames?
	100%
B. Which transport layer protocols were present and which one made up more of the traffic?
	TCP 96.7%, UDP 3.3%, TCP has more traffic
15. Now plot the UDP and TCP traffic, answer the following questions:
A. What is the highest number of TCP packets/sec observed? Around what time (second)?
	1330 packets/sec @ 1s
B. What is the highest number of UDP packets/sec observed? Around what time (second)?
	73 packets/sec @ 5s
C. What is the highest number of HTTP bits/sec observed? Around what time (second)?
	2.232e5 bits/sec @ 1s





Part 2

1. What is the protocol in packet #50 and what is it used for?
	SIP/SDP real time media initialization
2. What is the protocol in packet #55 and what is it used for?
	RTP streaming media
3. Examine the details of packet #55 and study the “payload type”. What is likely in this payload?
	ITU-T G.711 PCMU(0)	
	payload type PCMU
	contains audio
4. How much time elapses from packet #55 to packet #1329? How much Bytes has been used during this period? ​ Hint:​ Use IO Graph to answers these questions
	178.954983s - 166.095301s = 12.859682s
	22000 bytes/sec (approximation from plot)
	12.86s * 22000 bytes/s ~= 283 kB
5. What is going on in this capture?
	audio streaming / online calling
